# Smart Bike!

This project has a main goal - to create a RaspBerry Pi-controlled system to improve the cycling experience.

My contribution to the project was to develope an Android App to manage and present the information received from the RPi to the user.

There are available captures of the app and the final aspect of the project on the [Wiki](https://github.com/sokramcs/smart_bike/wiki) of this project.

This code was developed for the subject Multimedia Embeded Systems, developed during the second semester of the 2016/2017 academic year.

Kudos to Burak and Serhii for their excelent work.
